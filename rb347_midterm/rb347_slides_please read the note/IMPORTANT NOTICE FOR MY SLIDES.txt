Because GitHub does not allow me to upload file that is larger than 100MB, I can't upload my slides to it because in my slides there are some important videos, which is very large. Therefore, I upload it to Duke Box and shared the link to you, which is the following:

DukeBox also has time stamp. In GitHub I uploaded a version without video, which is small. However, for the in-class presentation, I still wish I can use the version WITH video. Thank you. 

If it is hard for you to download such a big file from box, I can come to class early tomorrow and AirDrop the file to your computer. Thank you for your understanding.
